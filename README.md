# UniverseGazers
APCS Final Project

## Basic Information
- **Group Name**: UniverseGazers
- **Group member names**: Judy Chen, Daphne Qin
- **Brief Project description**: We would like to replicate Jetpack Joyride in processing, except weâ€™ll name it UniverseGazers. It  will implement similar iconic features to the actual Jetpack Joyride game, such as allowing the player to collect coins along the way and requiring the player to avoid obstacles. As the game progresses, the player will face more challenges that make it harder to avoid the obstacles, such as laser beams that force the player to stay within a certain area of the screen. (Optional) Once the player dies, they may have the option to play a slot game where they win a prize that incentivizes them to play again (e.g. a new suit or a head start).
