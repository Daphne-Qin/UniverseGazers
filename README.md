# UniverseGazers
APCS Final Project

## Basic Information
- **Group Name**: UniverseGazers
- **Group member names**: Judy Chen, Daphne Qin
- **Brief Project description**: We would like to replicate Jetpack Joyride in processing, except we’ll name it UniverseGazers, as it’ll be space themed instead of mechanics themed. It  will implement similar iconic features to the actual Jetpack Joyride mobile game, such as allowing the player to collect coins along the way and requiring the player to avoid obstacles. As the game progresses, the player will face more challenges that make it harder to avoid the obstacles, such as laser beams that force the player to stay within a certain area of the screen, or missiles that fly across the screen. Once the player dies, their total score will be supplemented by the value that results from doubling the number of coins they collected. There will also be other optional features that are detailed in the optional features section of our prototype.
